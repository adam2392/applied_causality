# Applied Causality - Columbia University

The file readme.md contains an abstract of the project. At first you will write an “aspirational abstract,” one that describes the project you want to complete. As the semester continues, you will refine this abstract to accurately describe your project.

The file journal.md is a diary of your progress. It contains dated entries with a description of what you are doing, what you found, what you are thinking about, and so on. It is mainly a resource for you, but I will glance at it too (at the end of the semester). Update it at least once per week.

The doc/ directory contains latex documents that you are writing, a subdirectory for each one. 

The src/ directory contains the code you are writing.

The etc/ directory contains anything else—materials, notes, photos of whiteboards, and so on—that you want to keep track of.
